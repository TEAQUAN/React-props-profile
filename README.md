Things I did in this repository

Created a project using create-react-app.
Created a profile folder under src.
Created a profile component under /profile.
The profile component gets data (fullName, bio, profession) as props, and gets image as children props, and the function handleName functions as a prop that sends an alert message with the name of the profile user.
Define the default props for Profile component. 
Used PropsType to check props.  
Used inline style.
